## Overview:
### Goals and Specifications:
1- Mathematical operations

2- Quadratic equation

3- Array Operations

How to work?
After downloading the project and running it, it would be very easy steps:

As shown in the screenshots below.
Choose the model you want to make analysis with.
Once you've chosen a model, only the needed parameters will be enabled.
Only Model D/D/1/K-1 can be sketched. Also, you can make a query in.
Enjoy!

### Mathematical operations: 
in this part, the program performs one of mathematical operations like 
(addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division) 
on any two number or more.
